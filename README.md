### "Command Processor" (CP) Shell - An introductory project for myself (very incomplete)
- I am new to everything, including Markdown. Sorry in advance for the complete buggy mess of this project.
- Anyway, it's shared here now if you're interested.
- I don't ever have much time to work on this.
- I will get the GPL commands in there as soon as possible.

### There is a "CP-Extended-Utils" folder - everything in there is on hold for now until the main project (cpt2.py) hits version 1.0.
Oddities:
- "#cpfm.py" - That's a standalone version, but I'm still turning it into the version to be used with the shell. It will disappear eventually.
