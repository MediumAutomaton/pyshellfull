CP Extended Utilities Package version 0.1-0

The Extended Utilities is a collection of basic applications designed to work with the CP shell. The __init__.py file is automatically imported by CP if this package is present in the same directory as CP.

Below is a reference of all included utilities, their Python file names, and their purposes.

Each module contains more information about itself, such as version and technical information, as well as integration with other utilities.


ETUI - Emulated TTY UI - etui.py - Provides a TkInter-based terminal window. This file is also the CP-GUI compatibility layer, and other GUIs can be built using some of the features in this module.

AUI (standalone version) - aui.py - Pure TTY UI, fully compatible with the latest version of CP. Standalone version is often more up-to-date than CP's built-in copy, and can be used to run standalone versions of the other utilities.

CPFM (CP File Manager) - cpfm.py - A wrapper around pathlib.Path to provide basic file exploration and management

CP File Utilities - cpfh.py - This is another entire package of its own. File handling is done as it would be in a normal shell, using many simple commands. Provides capabilities far beyond CPFM, but possibly less intuitive.

CPled (CP line editor) - led.py - Simple file editing; integrates with CPFM as default file editor

abstract - ab.py - Like Debian's alias; abstract Python commands (or entire files) behind different CP commands. Adds fully custom commands to the CP command dictionary.

lightgraph - lg.py - A few simple graphical abilities for CP applications that can use them.

catalog - exutilcat.py - Learn about more recommended utilities for CP that aren't included with this package.


Some of these utilities have standalone versions. These are available in the "standalone" folder.
