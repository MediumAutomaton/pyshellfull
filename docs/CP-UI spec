CP-UI classes are alternate User Interfaces to the CP shell. CP's built-in HUI provides a normal terminal for the user and an extra Tk textbox as a debug console. Some people may want alternatives, so you can build them. You may format the UI and the output from CP any way you like; there is no standard formatting. As long as the UI has the correct functions for CP to call, you can do anything else with it.

It is recommended that you test your UI for compatibility with different CP versions, and it should at least be compatible with the latest version. The CP version that the module was designed for should be listed at the top of the module.


There is one really important thing about the code - the CP-UI class is the only class that doesn't rely on any other CP classes. It should be completely independent.
Note that commandline arguments are passed to the UI so it knows whether the --log argument was passed.


CP calls UI functions for user input/output. It currently uses 5 functions listed below, and your UI should support all of them:

say - Show the user a message.

ask - Get input from the user.

hlp - "help", but missing the e. Lists the available commands. The default UI lists the keys in the {comms} dictionary; you could write your own more advanced help if you like. It should be able to show commands added by imported modules, though.

debug - Extra debug messages. Not usually shown to the user. If the --log argument is given, these messages should be logged to "cplog.txt". You can log these messages in any format you like.

readLog - Read "cplog.txt".


AUI is a good simple example of how to build a CP-UI class.
